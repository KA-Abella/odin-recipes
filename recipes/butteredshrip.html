    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      It is simply made of Shrimp, garlic, butter, and lemon soda. Donâ€™t take
      the lemon soda for granted because it is a major ingredient. It refers to
      soda pop such as Sprite, 7Up, Sierra Mist, and the likes. The sweet taste
      of this dish is attributed to this ingredient. It also blends well with
      butter and garlic.
